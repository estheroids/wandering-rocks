## This Is Great and All, but So What?

>My task is to move, to shift systems (Barthes 10)

This is the hardest tab to write. Building this visualization
involves (involved) giving in to tendencies that I am trying to avoid in my
scholarship. Given that one of the goals was to learn the underlying
technology, however, it could not have been otherwise.

The issue is that animations provided by the JavaScript driving this project,
while super neat and cool, possibly do not actually tell us much _about_
“Wandering Rocks.” This initial concern is amplified by the following
reactions.

**Oh, just what the world needs, another deep dive on James Freakin’ Joyce.**
    There are lots of novels with fractured fabuly and sjužety (if we’re
    sticking to the Russian…). Similarly, there are lots of novels that provide
    extensive geographical detail, making mapping movements through a city
    possible. Why go back to such a canonical novel like _Ulysses_? Well, its
    very canonicity means that _a lot of the work has already been done_. Most
    of the geocoding for this section was just double-checking the work already
    done by Don Gifford and Ian Gunn and Clive Hart. Additionally, the timings
    would have been impossible for me to include without Hart’s own walking
    around in Dublin pretending to be an old woman or onelegged sailor,
    stopwatch in hand. I aim to make my spatiotemporal investigations of novels
    move past just the obvious hits like The Novel of High Modernism, but
    sometimes it’s worthwhile to build on a strong, already existing
    foundation. For example, the geographical “blunders” in the episode have
    already been dissected by generations of Joyce scholars, meaning when I
    stumbled upon them independent, I could rely on those scholars’ expertise
    and either accept or reject it. Finally, its canonicity helps with its
    profile.  I think the ideas and troubles hinted at in how I talk about this
    project can help frame how we look at spatiotemoporality for any novel (or
    perhaps aesthetic text), but since a lot of people care about Joyce, maybe
    this will give those ideas more visibility.

**Friend, _Ulysses_ takes place in Dublin in 1904. You have a 2017 basemap.**
    This is a valid concern, and it is one that merely putting a c.  1904
    georectified basemap underneath the dots and lines would not really solve.
    Johanna Drucker has been encouraging data-handling humanists to consider
    the value of georectification, as doing so merely “reconciles spatial data
    and maps… with a given standard, such as Google maps”(76–77).
    Georectification is the imposition of a specific, GIS kind of thinking on
    data (or “capta,” to use Drucker’s term) that does not exist with GIS in
    mind. As Drucker continues, “the greater intellectual challenge is to
    create spatial representations without referencing a pre-existing
    ground”(77). The information in _Ulysses_ takes a troubling trip to your
    computer screen: I _capture_ it and identify it as a datum (or captum).  I
    then spatiotemporally locate it through consulting some combination of
    Gifford, Gunn and Hart, Wikipedia, and Google. Following a conversion,
    perhaps with Google’s help, to Cartesian coordinates based on a measurement
    of the Earth’s shape from 1984, I line those coordinates up with a
    contemporary map of Dublin, making the risky guess that, as far as downtown
    is concerned, streets have not changed their shape all that much. Then
    Leaflet and D3, two software packages, combine to recalculate those
    coordinates into the little exploding dots you see. Every step adds new
    assumptions about how space and time work and move the capta farther from
    its source.  Furthermore, as soon as the jump is made to the digital, a
    faux-precision dominates, where, for example, something like the immense
    idea of “America” is reduced to a teeny exploding dot with its center in
    Kansas. These issues remain _unsolved_, and this project _fails_ Drucker’s
    challenge.

**You took preëxisting information and just added color and made it bounce.**
    Drucker distinguishes between information visualizations that produce the
    knowledge they draw and those that merely display information (3). It seems
    at first inarguable that this visualization does the latter only. Any new
    insights into “Wandering Rocks” seem destined to evoke the small surprise
    of the merely interesting: “surprising—but not that surprising” (Ngai 145).
    We have the delayed judgment of “isn’t it _interesting_ that Boylan’s
    section is the first to intrude on Conmee’s command of the fabula from the
    of the episode?” Moving that glimmer of interestingness somewhere else
    requires a deeper look into the structure of the episode I have an idea for
    a different form of visualizing the tension between fabula and sjužet
    (hint: a two-dimentional (time|plot)line), but that visualization would be
    exclusively temporal, thereby violating the canonical rule of
    spatiotemporal thinking, in a Bill Murray singing voice: “Spacetime,
    nothing but spacetime.” Fabula and sjužet seem to be strictly temporal
    terms, and it’s all too easy to treat them exclusively as such. But, then,
    that’s what we’re doing: taking the all too easy route. Nevertheless in
    that deferred judgment, Sianne Ngai also sees in finding something
    interesting the desire to “do criticism” (170). This aesthetic, after all,
    does have “the capacity to produce new knowledge” (171). It’s just not
    clear, as yet, how.

**OK, but this all still boils down to being just a chance to play with
    JavaScript, no?** Play! Isn’t that the point? Roland Barthes again, and to close
    out:

> Rereading draws the text out of its internal chronology (“this happens
> _before_ or _after_ that”) and recaptures a mythic time (without _before_ or
> _after_ [hence troubling Andersonian simultaneity]); rereading is no longer
> consumption, but play (that play which is the return of the different). If
> then, a deliberate contradiction in terms, we _immediately_ reread the text,
> it is in order to obstain, as though under the effect of a drug (that of
> recommencement, of different), not the _real_ text, but a plural text: the
> same and new (16)
