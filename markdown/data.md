## Data

There are three distinct datasets in this project, and all of them rely on the
previous work done by Don Gifford and Ian Gunn and Clive Hart.

The data in the first dataset are what I call “instances.” These are instances
of a place’s being mentioned in the text. I wrote a web application,
[`NYWalker`](http://nywalker.newyorkscapes.org/), that makes it easier to add
these instances by hand. They include a page number, a sequence, and a specific
location. To this data, I also added times, using Hart’s measurements. Hart did
not time each instance of a place’s being mentioned, so I guessed a time for a
lot of them. The dataset is further split into two explicit
spatiotemporalities, in that there is an “exterior” spacetime (where actors
are) and an “interior” spacetime (on what actors or the narrator remark). These
distinctions are local to this visualization and are not part of the `NYWalker`
data, which is [available for
download](http://nywalker.newyorkscapes.org/books/ulysses-1922).

The second dataset is built on the first. It includes “collisions.” These are
incidents that clearly take place at a specific place and time and feature
multiple actors but may not be explicitly noted in the text with an “instance”
(though a nearby instance often provides a clue for location and time!). An
instance is Conmee’s boarding a tram on *Newcomen Bridge*. A collision is
*Conmee’s* (actor 1) looking at the *awkward man* (actor 2) while on the tram.

The third dataset is mostly invisible at this time. It is made up of the paths
taken by around 30 different actors in the episode. Currently, only two are
visible: Conmee’s and the cavalcade’s. These two are available because,
apparently, Joyce relied on them in constructing the mechanics of the episode.
I drew all of the paths by hand and most rely on a lot of speculation, such as
how someone walks from O’Connell Bridge to “King Billy’s horse” on College
Green. The narrator does not tell us, after all, how the Breens took the trip.

There are several famous geographical “blunders” in the episode, where the
narrator (or a character) misidentifies a place. Three deserve special comment.
important here.  First, the Poddle river acts as an actor and not a place. This
permits its “misplacing” by the Wood Quay with no worry. Next, Farrell confuses
the Merrion Hall with the Metropolitan Hall. Finally, Stratton’s image welcomes
the cavalcade on a bridge spanning the Grand Canal that is referred to as the
“Royal Canal Bridge.” In both later instances, I treated these as
misidentifications, not as references to places far removed from the
spatiotemporal logic of either actor’s location and movement. 

In one last detail, Gifford writes that Thomas Court, the location of the
unfindable “mansion of the Kildares” that Love mentions, “was the main street
of the walled city of medieval Dublin. It is at present a series of streets
including Thomas Street” (268). I read the reference as one to, instead, the
[Liberty of Thomas Court and
Donore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_of_Thomas_Court_and_Donore), a
manor right outside the walled city and the location of the current Dublin
street Thomas Court. 

## Technology

This project is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/muziejus/wandering-rocks/). 

The scholarly incentive for the project was to think about wandering in the
city (for a completely unrelated project), but a secondary incentive was to get
to know a few technologies better, namely [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) and
[D3](http://d3js.org). Along the way, my familiarity with JavaScript and
especially [jQuery](http://jquery.com) also improved.

The text in these various tabs was written in Markdown and is converted to HTML
on the fly by [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown). The overall
aesthetic is farmed out to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), which is
extended with the [Bootstrap Toggle](http://www.bootstraptoggle.com/) extension
to make the handsome switches. The colorscheme on the map, of course, is from
[Color Brewer 2.0](http://colorbrewer2.org/).

If the project looks a lot like Chris Whong’s [NYC Taxis: A Day in the
Life](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/) visualization, that’s not a
coincidence. The project proved to me that it was possible to do a time
animation usefully using a combination of D3 and Leaflet (in fact, I found it
by just googling “d3 Leaflet animation” and clicking through the link on [Zev Ross’s top Google hit](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/09/30/use-the-amazing-d3-library-to-animate-a-path-on-a-leaflet-map/)). Mike Bostock’s OG “[D3 +
Leaflet](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/leaflet/)” demo describes how the various
dots and paths are converted from GeoJSON to SVG objects.

I also consulted two books rather extensively. Scott Murray’s [_Interactive
Data Visualization for the
Web_](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html) is a
great introduction to how weird D3 is. Once I read and understood everything in
that volume, Elijah Meeks’s [_D3.js in
Action_](https://www.manning.com/books/d3-js-in-action) served as handy
secondary resource. Both books could use updates, I feel, including sections
about, among other things, something like Leaflet. Meeks’s chapter on
geospatial information visualization, for example, rather startlingly answered
very few of my questions, largely because of the difficulty I encountered using
`d3.geoPath` with Leaflet instead of creating a sui generis map where I provide
even the basemap/shapes (see below).

Of course, I also used [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) extensively, but that goes without saying. 

### Let’s get technical…

For those seeking to emulate this project, by far and away the most complicated
aspect for me is/was figuring out how to control what a `Point` GeoJSON object
would look like using the `d3.geoPath` generator. It doesn’t draw a simple
`<circle>` SVG object, but, rather, creates a circle in the SVG `<path>` minilanguage
(visible under attribute `d`). Hence, the points don’t respond to the usual
changes in the `r` attribute like one might expect (or like every D3 tutorial
expects). 

This mostly became an issue because there are two maps in this visualization,
meaning two different `d3.geoTransform`s and `d3.geoProjection`s. I rewrote the
whole project using `<circle>`s with on-the-fly conversions for each, but it slowed the
site down. Bostock’s example, in contrast, streams points, which is, if I
understand correctly, asynchronous and much faster. So I had to stick to
`d3.geoPath`s and figure out how to manipulate `d`.

Actually, [this video from
DashingD3js](https://www.dashingd3js.com/lessons/d3-geo-path), despite its
hilariously dull repetition, was what finally made me understand what was going
on with the path and why changing the `r` attribute wasn’t doing anything!

### To Come…

I had hoped to have animated paths like in the NYC Taxi visualization above.
Whong has it kind of easy in this case, because the path is pre-defined (or at
least built w/ an api call), there’s a start point, an end point, and a
duration. The animation is made up of only one piece, then—that specific trip
from A to B. Here, rather, I have paths covered by people where they have to be
in many different, specific places at many different, specific times. That’s a
big project of splitting up the paths in the data I am not quite yet ready to
do.  Building up the other datasets was enough work for now. But in the future,
however, I’d love a little horse emoji representing the Cavalcade as it rides
to the Bazaar, say.
