# Fabula and Sjužet in “Wandering Rocks”

>Joyce wrote the *Wandering Rocks* with a map of Dublin before him on which
>were traced in red ink the paths of the Earl of Dudley and Father Conmee. He
>calculated to a minute the time necessary for his characters to cover a given
>distance of the city. (Budgen)

This is a web project that presents Episode 10 of *Ulysses* (“Wandering Rocks”)
as a data visualization treating two parallel concepts of space and two
contradictory concepts of time.

As the project matures, you can see it in action [on github
pages](http://muziejus.github.io/wandering-rocks/).

## Fabula and Sjužet?

“Fabula” and “sjužet” are two words that have entered into
narrative theory via Russian Formalism. Both “фабула” and “сюжет” can mean
“plot,” but early 20th century Russian critics narrowed their definitions.
Fabula, in its most basic sense, is the historical order of the events in a
story. Sjužet (from the French “sujet”) is the narrative order of the
story.

For example, in _Ulysses_, episode 3 (“Proteus”) is _after_ episode 4
(“Calypso”) in the novel’s fabula, as the events in the former take place
starting at 11:00 on Bloomsday, while the events in the latter cover
8:00–10:00. However, “Proteus” is _before_ “Calypso” in the sjužet, as it is
the third episode, and “Calypso” is the fourth. Reading _Ulysses_’s fabula
would force reading episode 4 before episode 3. Reading its sjužet reverses the
process.

These contrasting and perhaps contradictory temporalities (or, better,
spatiotemporalities) separate the novel from the world that the novel creates.
When discussing story/discourse, histoire/discours, and
fabula/sjužet, Woloch adds that

>All these dichotomous terms refer, finally, to the essentially divided nature
>of the literary text, as it is torn between form and content; between the
>signified and the signifier; between the text’s linguistic world—words,
>sentences, chapters—and the imagined world that we grasp at through the text.
>Discourse [sjužet] points us to the narrative’s actual language and structure;
>story [fabula] to the fictional events that we reconstruct through the
>narrative (38).

The world generated by the novel has a spacetime that interacts with the
aesthetic means by which the world is uncovered in the plot. The elements of
the fabula are abstracted out and exist in a spatiotemporality we could call
“geohistory,” one where time moves only in one direction. Hence the fabula of
the Dublin created in “Wandering Rocks” could actually begin with the 8th Earl
of Kildare, whose late 15th century rule of Ireland comes up in conversation
between Lambert and O’Molloy, as those acts are a cause whose effect (the
conversation), bubbles up on Bloomsday. For the purposes of this visualization,
however, the timeline of the fabula marches in its solitary direction from 14:55
to 15:58 on 16 June 1904.

The elements of the fabula, however, provide the foundation for the sjužet.
Here, the building blocks of the novel world’s geohistory are recombined with
aesthetics in mind. Within the sjužet, the fabula is reordered, and the
timeline is no longer a persistent march forward. 

Though _Ulysses_ moves linearly for the most part (save the clock’s resetting
at the beginning of “Calypso” as noted above), in “Wandering Rocks,” it’s clear
how different fabula and sjužet can be. Because of Joyce’s meticulous design
for the chapter, we can see it as a network of crisscrossing timelines. The
first moment in the episode is the same in both fabula and sjužet; Conmee
checks his watch. Similarly, the last is the same in both as well; Artifoni
finally catches a Dalkey tram just as the viceregal cavalcade passes him by.
But these events bookend something that jumps back and forth, underscoring the
different modes of spatiotemporality offered by fabula and sjužet. Yet because
of the necessary temporal component of spatiotemporality, it doesn’t suffice to
think of “Wandering Rocks” with a fixed map showing everyone’s journeys. The
animation—two of them, in fact—is the only way to provide a glimpse of the
“simultaneity,” such as it exists, of the episode (Anderson, 24–26).

Furthermore, “Wandering Rocks”’s focus on minor characters also highlights the
tension between the world of the novel (where the fabula is) and its art (where
the sjužet is). The episode takes the reader out of the frame of _The Odyssey_,
of the story of Stephen and Bloom. Instead, it showcases Dublin and its
inhabitants, a side story populated by masses of minor characters not typically
given the space to breathe in a novel. 


# Wandering Rocks

“Wandering Rocks” is the most obviously complexly, mechanically
intertwined episode in James Joyce’s 1992 novel _Ulysses_. It also stands
outside of the rest of the novel in its use of spatiotemporality, focus on
secondary characters, and lack of an analogue in _The Odyssey_.

_Ulysses_, after all, has structural similarities to *The Odyssey*, but in the
latter, Odysseus is only told about the danger of sailing through the Wandering
Rocks. He takes his chances, instead, with Scylla and Charybdis. As a result,
the episode provides Joyce a bit of space in which to play outside the frame of
the rest of the novel, which is, of course, already a very forgiving frame.

Ellmann notes that the episode brings “the city of Dublin even more fully into
the book by focusing upon it rather than upon Bloom or Stephen,” the two main
characters of the novel (452). In its difference from the rest of the novel on
these terms, it also reflects back on the rest of the novel. Gilbert adds,
“In its structure and its _technic_ (“labyrinth”) this episode may be regarded
as a small-scale model of _Ulysses_ as a whole” (227).

As a novel-within-a-novel, then, the episode is broken up into 19 distinct
sections. Each centers around, more or less, a different character. Some move
around, with the greatest distance covered in the first and last sections. But
other characters remain in one place during the course of their section.
Furthermore, each section except the last features at least one “intrusion,”
which acts like a jump cut taking us to another location but at the same time.
Because the intrusions typically refer to characters who show up elsewhere in
the episode, it becomes possible to plot out a timeline of events, which is
what this visualization does.  We know person *x* was at place _n_ to meet
person *y*, but over at _m_ later to meet person *z*. But through the
intrusions, we also know where *x* and *z* were at the same time, though
separate from one another. These collisions are nowhere clearer than in the
final section, which features a viceregal cavalcade riding from Phoenix Park to
the Mirus Bazaar in Ballsbridge, thereby riding straight through downtown
Dublin, where nearly every character in the episode has an opportunity to
remark on the cavalcade as it rides past.

A brief description of each of the 19 episodes:

1. Father Conmee walks from his church to Artane, taking the tram for a part of his trip.

2. Corny Kelleher tends to a coffin and speaks to a constable.

3. A onelegged sailor walks to Eccles Street, where he is given money including a coin tossed by Molly Bloom from her window.

4. Katey and Boody Dedalus arrive home. Maggy offers them soup.

5. Blazes Boylan orders a package at Thornton’s to be sent to Molly and leers at the shopgirl.

6. Stephen Dedalus and Almidano Artifoni talk by Trinity College. Artifoni misses his tram.

7. Miss Dunne does some work and gets a phone call from Boylan.

8. Ned Lambert gives a tour of the council chamber of St. Mary’s Abbey to Hugh Love. J. J. O’Malloy accompanies.

9. Lenehan and M‘Coy walk from Crampton Court to Temple Bar to the Liffey. Lenehan tells a story about groping Molly.

10. Leopold Bloom decides which books to buy for Molly.

11. Dilly Dedalus runs into Simon Dedalus and asks him for money.

12. Tom Kernan walks from completing a business deal to the Liffey where he just misses the cavalcade.

13. Stephen looks over some books and runs into Dilly, who has bought a French primer.

14. Simon, Father Cowley, and Ben Dollard walk along the Liffey toward the Ormond Hotel.

15. Martin Cunningham, Jack Power, John Wyse Nolan, and Jimmy Henry walk from Dublin Castle to Kavanagh’s winerooms.

16. Buck Mulligan and Haines order mélanges at D. B. C. while John Howard Parnell plays chess.

17. Artifoni still chases his tram, while Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walks along Merrion Square.

18. Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam starts to bring pork steaks back home.

19. The viceregal cavalcade leaves Phoenix Park and drives through downtown Dublin on the way to the Mirus Bazaar.


## Spacetime, Nothing but Spacetime…

> Did it start with Bergson, or before? Space was treated as the dead, the
> fixed, the undialectical, the immobile. Time, on the contrary, was richness,
> fecundity, life, dialectic. (Foucault 70)

The relationship between space, spacetime, and the novel has been at the center
of my work for almost a decade now. And still I often start with this nearly
throwaway quote by Foucault from an interview that seems often cited instead
for its final kicker, “Geography must indeed necessarily lie at the heart of my
concerns” (77). But the solution to geography’s second-class status compared to
time isn’t solved by doubling down on geography, unless that is done just to
bring geography up to the same speed as time. 

In literary study, we have a nearly century-old model for thinking literature
spatiotemporally (as opposed to just temporally or, in a more postmodern,
Jamesonian vein, just spatially). Bakhtin defines the chronotope as that which
demonstrates the “intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships
that are artistically expressed in literature.” Based on Einstein’s Theory of
Relativity, the chronotope “expresses the inseparability of space and time”
(84). Many critical geographers (Massey, Soja, Harvey) have insisted on
merging the two for decades now, but doing so continues to present challenges
to literary study, at least when thinking about the worlds a novel creates.

Authors of aesthetic texts have followed Aristotle’s command that a work have a
beginning, middle, and end for over two millennia. There is, then, an intrinsic
temporality provided merely by how we consume the text. Even edge cases like
Choose your Own Adventures or _Rayuela_ still provide a sort of linearity on
the fly. A sjužet remains; it’s just more reader-driven and divorced from the
increment variable we typically call “page number.” Barthes may write that “for
those of us who are trying to establish a plural… the reading must also be
plural, that is, without order of entrance,” but reaching his height of
plurality or writerliness is a summit that I’m still trying to work through
(and one more interconnected, as I believe its invocation here shows, with
spatiotemoprality than might be at first assumed). Barthes encourages us to
read “the text as if it had already been read,” which helps to manhandle and
interrupt the text (15).

Focussing on the competing, colliding, contradicting, and circumventing
spatiotemporalities in “Wandering Rocks” through this visualization actually
helps reach this goal of a shattered text, with what feels like literally
hundreds of obvious points of entry providing another rereading, another time
through, another production.

No matter what I’ve called spatiotemporalities in novels before (“sites,”
“разноречие” and “разномирность,” and so on), as I try to build out my idea of
“everyday criticism,” any kind of working over a text that allows these
variable points of entry and variable productions, these writings by readers,
must be useful towards that goal.

## Data

There are three distinct datasets in this project, and all of them rely on the
previous work done by Gifford and Gunn and Hart.

The data in the first dataset are what I call “instances.” These are instances
of a place’s being mentioned in the text. I wrote a web application,
[`NYWalker`](http://nywalker.newyorkscapes.org/), that makes it easier to add
these instances by hand. They include a page number, a sequence, and a specific
location. To this data, I also added times, using Hart’s measurements. Hart did
not time each instance of a place’s being mentioned, so I guessed a time for a
lot of them. The dataset is further split by spatiotemporalities, in that there
is an “exterior” spacetime and an “interior” spacetime. These distinctions are
local to this visualization and are not part of the `NYWalker` data, which is
[available for download](http://nywalker.newyorkscapes.org/books/ulysses-1922).

The second dataset is built on the first. It includes “collisions.” These are
incidents that clearly take place at a specific place and time and feature
multiple actors but may not be explicitly noted in the text with an “instance”
(though a nearby instance often provides a clue for location and time!). An
instance is Conmee’s boarding a tram on *Newcomen Bridge*. A collision is
*Conmee’s* (actor 1) looking at the *awkward man* (actor 2) while on the tram.

The third dataset is mostly invisible at this time. It is made up of the paths
taken by around 30 different actors in the episode. Currently, only two are
visible: Conmee’s and the cavalcades’ paths. These two are available because,
apparently, Joyce relied on them in constructing the mechanics of the episode.
These paths I drew by hand and rely on a lot of speculation, such as how
someone walks from O’Connell Bridge to “King Billy’s horse” on College Green.
The narrator does not tell us how the Breens took the trip.

There are several famous geographical “blunders” in the episode, where the
narrator (or a character) misidentifies a place. Three deserve special comment.
important here.  First, the Poddle river acts as an actor and not a place. This
permits its “misplacing” by the Wood Quay with no worry. Next, Farrell confuses
the Merrion Hall with the Metropolitan Hall. Finally, Stratton’s image welcomes
the cavalcade on a bridge spanning the Grand Canal that is referred to as the
“Royal Canal Bridge.” In both later instances, I treated these as
misidentifications, not as references to places far removed from the
spatiotemporal logic of either actor’s location and movement. 

Finally, Gifford writes that Thomas Court, the location of the unfindable
“mansion of the Kildares” that Love mentions, “was the main street of the
walled city of medieval Dublin. It is at present a series of streets including
Thomas Street” (268). I read the reference as one to, instead, the
[Liberty of Thomas Court and
Donore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_of_Thomas_Court_and_Donore), a
manor right outside the walled city and the location of the current Dublin
street Thomas Court. 

## Technology

The scholarly incentive for the project was to think about wandering in the
city, but a secondary incentive was to get to know a few technologies better,
namely [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) and [D3](http://d3js.org). Along the
way, my familiarity with JavaScript and especially [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
also improved.

The text in these various tabs was written in Markdown and is converted to HTML
on the fly by [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown). The overall
aesthetic is farmed out to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), which is
extended with the [Bootstrap Toggle](http://www.bootstraptoggle.com/) extension
to make the handsome switches.

If the project looks a lot like Chris Whong’s [NYC Taxis: A Day in the
Life](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/) visualization, that’s not a
coincidence. The project proved to me that it was possible to do a time
animation usefully using a combination of D3 and Leaflet (in fact, I found it
by just googling “d3 Leaflet”). Mike Bostock’s OG “[D3 +
Leaflet](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/leaflet/)” demo underlies how the various
dots and paths are converted from GeoJSON to SVG objects.

I also consulted two books rather extensively. Scott Murray’s [_Interactive
Data Visualization for the
Web_](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html) is a
great introduction to how weird D3 is. Once I read and understood everything
there, Elijah Meeks’s [_D3.js in
Action_](https://www.manning.com/books/d3-js-in-action) served as handy
secondary resource. Both books need updates, I feel. Those updates could
include dealing with, among other things, something like Leaflet. Meeks’s
chapter on geospatial information visualization, for example, rather
startlingly answered very few of my questions, largely because of the weirdness
of using `d3.geoPath` with Leaflet instead of creating a sui generis map where
I provide even the basemap/shapes (see below).

Of course, I also used [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) extensively, but that goes without saying. 

### Let’s get technical…

For those seeking to emulate this project, by far and away the most complicated
aspect for me is/was figuring out how to control what a `Point` GeoJSON object
would look like using the `d3.geoPath` generator. It doesn’t draw a simple
`<circle>` SVG object, but, rather, creates a circle in the SVG `<path>` minilanguage
(visible under attribute `d`). Hence, the points don’t respond to the usual
changes in the `r` attribute like one might expect (or like every D3 tutorial
expects). 

This mostly became an issue because there are two maps in this visualization,
meaning two different `d3.geoTransform`s and `d3.geoProjection`s. I rewrote the
whole project using `<circle>`s with on-the-fly conversions for each, but it slowed the
site down. Bostock’s example, in contrast, streams points, which is, if I
understand correctly, asynchronous and much faster. So I had to stick to
`d3.geoPath`s and figure out how to manipulate `d`.

Actually, [this video from
DashingD3js](https://www.dashingd3js.com/lessons/d3-geo-path), despite its
hilariously dull repetition, was what finally made me understand what was going
on with the path and why changing the `r` attribute wasn’t doing anything!

### To Come…

I had hoped to have animated paths like in the NYC Taxi visualization above.
Whong has it kind of easy in this case, because the path is pre-defined,
there’s a start point, an end point, and a duration. The animation is made up
of only one piece, then—that specific path. Here, rather, I have paths covered
by people where they have to be in many different places at many different
times. That’s a granular return to the data I am not quite yet ready to do.
Building up the other datasets was enough work for now. But in the future,
however, I’d love a little horse emoji representing the Cavalcade as it rides
to the Bazaar, say.

## This Is Great and All, but So What?

>My task is to move, to shift systems (Barthes 10)

This is the hardest tab to write. Building this visualization
involves (involved) giving in to tendencies that I am trying to avoid in my
scholarship. Given that one of the goals was to learn the underlying
technology, however, it could not have been otherwise.

The issue is that animations provided by the JavaScript driving this project,
while super neat and cool, possibly do not actually tell us much _about_
“Wandering Rocks.” This initial concern is amplified by the following
reactions.

**Oh, just what the world needs, another deep dive on James Freakin’ Joyce.**
There are lots of novels with fractured fabuly and sjužety (if we’re sticking
to the Russian…). Similarly, there are lots of novels that provide extensive
geographical detail, making mapping movements through a city possible. Why go
back to such a canonical novel like _Ulysses_? Well, its very canonicity means
that _a lot of the work has already been done_. Most of the geocoding for this
section was just double-checking the work already done by Gifford and Gunn and
Hart. Additionally, the timings would have been impossible for me to include
without Hart’s own walking around in Dublin pretending to be an old woman or
onelegged sailor, stopwatch in hand. I aim to make my spatiotemporal
investigations of novels move past just the obvious hits like The Novel of High
Modernism, but sometimes it’s worthwhile to build on a strong, already existing
foundation. For example, the geographical “blunders” in the episode have
already been dissected by generations of Joyce scholars, meaning when I
stumbled upon them independent, I could rely on those scholars’ expertise and
either accept or reject it. Finally, its canonicity helps with its profile.  I
think the ideas and troubles hinted at in how I talk about this project can
help frame how we look at spatiotemoporality for any novel (or perhaps
aesthetic text), but since a lot of people care about Joyce, maybe this will
give those ideas more visibility.

**Friend, _Ulysses_ takes place in Dublin in 1904. You have a 2017
basemap.** This is a valid concern, and it is one that merely putting a c.
1904 georectified basemap underneath the dots and lines would not really solve.
Drucker has been encouraging data-handling humanists to consider the value of
georectification, as doing so merely “reconciles spatial data and maps… with a
given standard, such as Google maps”(76–77). Georectification is the imposition
of a specific, GIS kind of thinking on data (or “capta,” to use Drucker’s term)
that does not exist with GIS in mind. As Drucker continues, “the greater
intellectual challenge is to create spatial representations without referencing
a pre-existing ground”(77). The information in _Ulysses_ takes a troubling trip
to your computer screen: I _capture_ it and identify it as a datum (or captum).
I then spatiotemporally locate it through consulting some combination of
Gifford, Gunn and Hart, Wikipedia, and Google. Following a conversion, perhaps
with Google’s help, to Cartesian coordinates based on a measurement of the
Earth’s shape from 1984, I line those coordinates up with a contemporary
map of Dublin, making the risky guess that, as far as downtown is concerned,
streets have not changed their shape all that much. Then Leaflet and D3, two
software packages, combine to recalculate those coordinates into the little
exploding dots you see. Every step adds new assumptions about how space and
time work and move the capta farther from its source.  Furthermore, as soon as
the jump is made to the digital, a faux-precision dominates, where, for
example, something like the immense idea of “America” is reduced to a teeny
exploding dot with its center in Kansas. These issues remain _unsolved_, and
this project _fails_ Drucker’s challenge.

**You took preëxisting information and just added color and made it bounce.**
    Drucker distinguishes between information visualizations that produce the
    knowledge they draw and those that merely display information (3). It seems
    at first inarguable that this visualization does the latter only. Any new
    insights into “Wandering Rocks” seem destined to evoke the small surprise
    of the merely interesting: “surprising—but not that surprising” (Ngai 145).
    We have the delayed judgment of “isn’t it _interesting_ that Boylan’s
    section is the first to intrude on Conmee’s command of the fabula from the
    of the episode?” Moving that glimmer of interestingness somewhere else
    requires a deeper look into the structure of the episode I have an idea for
    a different form of visualizing the tension between fabula and sjužet
    (hint: a two-dimentional (time|plot)line), but that visualization would be
    exclusively temporal, thereby violating the canonical rule of
    spatiotemporal thinking, in a Bill Murray singing voice: “Spacetime,
    nothing but spacetime.” Fabula and sjužet seem to be strictly temporal
    terms, and it’s all too easy to treat them exclusively as such. But, then,
    that’s what we’re doing: taking the all too easy route. Nevertheless in
    that deferred judgment, Sianne Ngai also sees in finding something
    interesting the desire to “do criticism” (170). This aesthetic, after all,
    does have “the capacity to produce new knowledge,” after all. It’s just not
    clear, as yet, how (171).

**OK, but this all still boils down to being just a chance to play with
    JavaScript, no?** Play! Isn’t that the point? Barthes again, and to close
    out:

> Rereading draws the text out of its internal chronology (“this happens
> _before_ or _after_ that”) and recaptures a mythic time (without _before_ or
> _after_ [hence troubling Andersonian simultaneity]); rereading is no longer
> consumption, but play (that play which is the return of the different). If
> then, a deliberate contradiction in terms, we _immediately_ reread the text,
> it is in order to obstain, as though under the effect of a drug (that of
> recommencement, of different), not the _real_ text, but a plural text: the
> same and new (16)
