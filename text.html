      The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S. J. reset his smooth watch
      in his interior pocket as he came down the <span class="place" id="instance_5867">presbytery</span> steps. Five to
      three. Just nice time to walk to <span class="place" id="instance_5866">Artane</span>. What was that boy’s name again?
      Dignam. Yes. <em>Vere dignum et iustum est</em>. Brother Swan was the person
      to see. Mr Cunningham’s letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good
      practical catholic: useful at mission time.
    </p>

    <p>
      A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his
      crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the <span id="instance_5868">convent of the
        sisters of charity</span> and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very
      reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his
      purse held, he knew, one silver crown.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee crossed to <span class="place" id="instance_5869">Mountjoy square</span>. He thought, but not for long,
      of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,
      ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words:
      <em>If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have
        abandoned me in my old days</em>. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking
      leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M. P.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to <span class="place" id="instance_5870">Buxton</span>
      probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at
      <span class="place" id="instance_5871">Belvedere</span>? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.
      And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in <span class="place" id="instance_5872">London</span>. The house was still sitting, to
      be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was
      very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O,
      yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M. P.
      Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M. P.
      Yes, he would certainly call.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
      jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again,
      in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father
      Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?
    </p>

    <p>
      A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his
      way. Beyond a doubt. He loved <span class="place" id="instance_5873">Ireland</span>, he said, and he loved the Irish.
      Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?
    </p>

    <p>
      O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the <span class="place" id="instance_5874">corner 
      of Mountjoy square</span>. Yes: they were from <span class="place" id="instance_5875">Belvedere</span>. The little house. Aha. And were
      they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his
      name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man?
      His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and
      pointed to the <span class="place" id="instance_5876">red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      —But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:
    </p>

    <p>
      —O, sir.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter
      to father provincial into the mouth of the <span class="place" id="instance_5877">bright red letterbox</span>. Father
      Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along <span class="place" id="instance_5878">Mountjoy square east</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Denis J. Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c, in silk hat, slate
      frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender
      trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave
      deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady
      Maxwell at the corner of <span class="place" id="instance_5879">Dignam’s court</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?
    </p>

    <p>
      Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the
      farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and
      saluted. How did she do?
    </p>

    <p>
      A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to
      think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he
      say?... such a queenly mien.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee walked down <span class="place" id="instance_5880">Great Charles street</span> and glanced at the shutup
      <span class="place" id="instance_5881">free church</span> on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B. A. will (D. V.)
      speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say
      a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They
      acted according to their lights.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the <span class="place" id="instance_5882">North Circular road</span>. 
      It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important
      thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from <span class="place" id="instance_5883">Richmond street</span>. All
      raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.
      Christian brother boys.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5884">Saint Joseph’s church</span>, 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5885">Portland row</span>. 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5886">For aged and virtuous females</span>.
      Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but
      occasionally they were also badtempered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Near <span class="place" id="instance_5887">Aldborough house</span> Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
      nobleman. And now it was an office or something.
    </p>

    <p> 
      Father Conmee began to walk along the <span class="place"
        id="instance_5888">North Strand road</span> and was saluted by Mr
      William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of <span class="place"
        id="instance_5889">his shop</span>. Father Conmee saluted Mr William
      Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample
      cools of butter. He passed <span class="place"
        id="instance_5890">Grogan’s the Tobacconist</span> against which
      newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in <span class="place" id="instance_5891">New York</span>. In
      <span class="place" id="instance_5892">America</span> those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to
      die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee went by <span class="place" id="instance_5893">
      Daniel Bergin’s publichouse</span> against the window of
      which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee passed <span class="place" id="instance_5894">H. J. 
      O’Neill’s funeral establishment</span> where Corny
      Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.
      A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted
      the constable. In <span class="place" id="instance_5895">Youkstetter’s</span>, 
      the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee
      observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in
      tubes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moored under the trees of <span class="place" id="instance_5896">Charleville Mall</span> Father Conmee saw a
      turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty
      straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above
      him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of
      the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it
      out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor
      people.
    </p>

    <p> 
      On <span class="place" id="instance_5897">Newcomen bridge</span> the
      very reverend John Conmee S. J. of <span class="place"
        id="instance_5898">saint Francis Xavier’s church</span>, <span
        class="place" id="instance_5899">upper Gardiner street</span>, stepped
      on to an outward bound tram.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of
      <span class="place" id="instance_5900">saint Agatha’s church</span>, 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5901">north William street</span>, on to 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5902">Newcomen bridge</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <span class="place" id="instance_5903">Newcomen bridge</span> Father 
      Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for
      he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5904">Mud Island</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with
      care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence
      and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.
      Passing <span class="place" id="instance_5905">the ivy church</span> 
      he reflected that the ticket inspector usually
      made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The
      solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive
      for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
      Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee
      supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with
      the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently,
      tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily,
      sweetly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that
      the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the
      seat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
      mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <span class="place" id="instance_5906">Annesley bridge</span> the 
      tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
      woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the
      bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and
      a market net: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
      basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
      the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had
      always to be told twice <em>bless you, my child</em>, that they have been
      absolved, <em>pray for me</em>. But they had so many worries in life, so many
      cares, poor creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at
      Father Conmee.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and
      of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission and of
      the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and
      yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last
      hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, <em>Le
        Nombre des Élus</em>, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were
      millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the
      faith had not (D. V.) been brought. But they were God’s souls, created by
      God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a
      waste, if one might say.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the <span class="place" id="instance_5907">Howth road stop</span> Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
      conductor and saluted in his turn.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <span class="place" id="instance_5908">Malahide road</span> was quiet. 
      It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.
      The joybells were ringing in gay <span class="place" id="instance_5909">Malahide</span>. 
      Lord Talbot de <span class="place" id="instance_5910">Malahide</span>,
      immediate hereditary lord admiral of <span class="place" id="instance_5911">Malahide</span> 
      and the seas adjoining.
      Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.
      Those were oldworldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times
      in the barony.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book <em>Old Times in the
        Barony</em> and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of
      Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.
    </p>

    <p>
      A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5912">lough Ennel</span>,
      Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,
      not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the
      jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed
      adultery fully, <em>eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris</em>, with her
      husband’s brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as
      women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for
      man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and
      honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at
      smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit
      clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,
      were impalmed by don John Conmee.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a charming day.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
      curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock
      of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. <em>Moutonner</em>, the French
      said. A just and homely word.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds
      over <span class="place" id="instance_5913">Rathcoffey</span>. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of
      <span class="place" id="instance_5914">Clongowes field</span>. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard
      the cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet
      evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An
      ivory bookmark told him the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee read in secret <em>Pater</em> and <em>Ave</em> and crossed his breast. <em>Deus
        in adiutorium</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he
      came to <em>Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in
        eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a
      young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised
      his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
      detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
      breviary. <em>Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis
        formidavit cor meum</em>.

    <p>
      Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye
      at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect,
      went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
      furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
      to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
      and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Father John Conmee stepped into the <span class="place" id="instance_5915">Dollymount</span> 
      tram on <span class="place" id="instance_5916">Newcomen bridge</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
      downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.
    </p>

    <p>
      Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.
    </p>

    <p>
      —That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Ay, Corny Kelleher said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —It’s very close, the constable said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth
      while a generous white arm from a <span class="place" id="instance_5917">
      window in Eccles street</span> flung forth a
      coin.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What’s the best news? he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with
      bated breath.

      A onelegged sailor crutched himself round 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5918">MacConnell’s corner</span>, skirting
      Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up 
      <span class="place" id="instance_missing">Eccles street</span>. Towards
      Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5919">his doorway</span>, he growled unamiably:
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>For England</em>...
    </p>

    <p>
      He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted
      and growled:
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>home and beauty</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      J. J. O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the
      <span class="place" id="instance_5920">warehouse</span> with a visitor.
    </p>

    <p>
      A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it
      into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly
      at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four
      strides.
    </p>

    <p>
      He halted and growled angrily:
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>For England</em>...
    </p>

    <p>
      Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,
      gaping at his stump with their yellow-slobbered mouths.
    </p>

    <p>
      He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head
      towards a window and bayed deeply:
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>home and beauty</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.
      The blind of the <span class="place" id="instance_5921">window</span> 
      was drawn aside. A card <em>Unfurnished Apartments</em>
      slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was
      seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A
      woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the
      path.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
      minstrel’s cap, saying:

      Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming

      Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds
      twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.

      Father Conmee walked through <span class="place" id="instance_6171">Clongowes fields</span>, his thinsocked ankles
      tickled by stubble.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Where did you try? Boody asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<span class="place" id="instance_5923">M’Guinness’s</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Bad cess to her big face! she cried.
    </p>

    <p>
      Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What’s in the pot? she asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Shirts, Maggy said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Boody cried angrily:
    </p>

    <p>
      —Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?
    </p>

    <p>
      Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:
    </p>

    <p>
      —And what’s in this?
    </p>

    <p>
      A heavy fume gushed in answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Peasoup, Maggy said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Where did you get it? Katey asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<span class="place" id="instance_5924">Sister Mary Patrick</span>, Maggy said.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lacquey rang his bell.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Barang!
    </p>

    <p>
      Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:
    </p>

    <p>
      —Give us it here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey,
      sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her
      mouth random crumbs:
    </p>

    <p>
      —A good job we have that much. Where’s Dilly?
    </p>

    <p>
      —Gone to meet father, Maggy said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:
    </p>

    <p>
      —Our father who art not in heaven.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed:
    </p>

    <p>
      —Boody! For shame!
    </p>

    <p>
      A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the
      <span class="place" id="instance_6175">Liffey</span>, under 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5925">Loopline bridge</span>, shooting the rapids where water chafed

    <p>
      The blond girl in <span class="place" id="instance_5928">Thornton’s</span> 
      bedded the wicker basket with rustling
      fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper
      and a small jar.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Put these in first, will you? he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.
    </p>

    <p>
      —That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.
    </p>

    <p>
      She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe
      shamefaced peaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the
      fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red
      tomatoes, sniffing smells.

      filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past <span class="place" id="instance_5959">Tangier lane</span>,
      plodding towards their goal.
    </p>

    <p>
      He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from
      his fob and held it at its chain’s length.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Can you send them by tram? Now?
    </p>

    <p>
      A darkbacked figure under <span class="place" id="instance_5931">Merchants’ arch</span> scanned books on the hawker’s
      cart.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?
    </p>

    <p>
      —O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Will you write the address, sir?
    </p>

    <p>
      Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Send it at once, will you? he said. It’s for an invalid.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Yes, sir. I will, sir.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What’s the damage? he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took
      a red carnation from the tall stemglass.
    </p>

    <p>
      —This for me? he asked gallantly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie
      a bit crooked, blushing.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Yes, sir, she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the
      red flower between his smiling teeth.
    </p>

    <p>
      —May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.

    <p>
      He gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at <span class="place" id="instance_5932">Goldsmith’s knobby poll</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,
      gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men’s arms frankly round their
      stunted forms. They looked from <span class="place" id="instance_5933">
      Trinity</span> to the blind columned porch of
      the <span class="place" id="instance_5934">bank of Ireland</span> where pigeons roocoocooed.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee</em>, Almidano Artifoni said, 
      <em>quand’ ero
        giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.
        È peccato. Perchè la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.
        Invece, Lei si sacrifica</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Sacrifizio incruento</em>, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in
      slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Speriamo</em>, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. <em>Ma, dia retta a
        me. Ci rifletta</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the stern <span class="place" id="instance_5935">stone hand of Grattan</span>, 
      bidding halt, an <span class="place" id="instance_5936">Inchicore</span> tram
      unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Ci rifletterò</em>, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Ma, sul serio, eh?</em> Almidano Artifoni said.
    </p>

    <p>
      His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously
      an instant and turned quickly towards a <span class="place" id="instance_5937">Dalkey</span> tram.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Eccolo</em>, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. <em>Venga a trovarmi e ci
        pensi. Addio, caro.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Arrivederla, maestro</em>, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was
      freed. <em>E grazie</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Di che?</em> Almidano Artifoni said. <em>Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,
      trotted on stout trousers after the <span class="place" id="instance_5938">Dalkey</span> tram. In vain he trotted,
      signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
      implements of music through <span class="place" id="instance_5939">Trinity gates</span>.

      far back in <span class="place" id="instance_5941">her drawer</span> and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her

      Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?
      Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.

    <p>
      The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:
      six.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:

      —16 June 1904.
    </p>

    <p> 
      Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between <span class="place"
        id="instance_5942">Monypeny’s</span> corner and the <span class="place"
        id="instance_5943">slab where Wolfe Tone’s statue was not</span>, eeled
      themselves turning <span class="place" id="instance_6172">H. E. L. Y.’S</span> 
      and plodded back as they had come.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming
      soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and
      capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She’s not nicelooking,
      is she? The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that
      fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a
      concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s. They kick out grand. Shannon and
      all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he
      won’t keep me here till seven.
    </p>

    <p>
      The telephone rang rudely by her ear.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I’ll ring them up after five. Only
      those two, sir, for <span class="place" id="instance_5944">Belfast</span>

      six. I’ll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.
    </p>

    <p>
      She scribbled three figures on an envelope.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from <em>Sport</em> was in looking for you. Mr

      Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Who’s that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?
    </p>

    <p>
      —<span class="place" id="instance_5953">Ringabella</span> and 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5954">Crosshaven</span>, a voice replied groping for foothold.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his
      pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long
      soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and
      mouldy air closed round them.
    </p>

    <p>
      —How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.
    </p>

    <p> 
      —Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic
      <span class="place" id="instance_5947">council chamber of saint Mary’s
        abbey</span> where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534.
      This is the most historic spot in all <span class="place"
        id="instance_5948">Dublin</span>.  O’Madden Burke is going to write
      something about it one of these days.  The <span class="place"
        id="instance_5949">old bank of Ireland</span> was over the way till the
      time of the union and the <span class="place" id="instance_5950">original
        jews’ temple</span> was here too before they built their 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5951">synagogue over in Adelaide road</span>. 
      You were never here before, Jack, were you?  
    </p>

    <p>
      —No, Ned.
    </p>

    <p>
      —He rode down through <span class="place" id="instance_5952">Dame walk</span>, 
      the refined accent said, if my memory
      serves me. The <span class="place" id="instance_5955">mansion of the Kildares</span> was in 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5956">Thomas court</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      —That’s right, Ned Lambert said. That’s quite right, sir.
    </p>

    <p>
      —If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow
      me perhaps...
    </p>

    <p>
      —Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I’ll
      get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here
      or from here.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled
      seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I’m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won’t trespass on
      your valuable time...
    </p>

    <p>
      —You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next
      week, say. Can you see?
    </p>

    <p>
      —Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among
      the pillars. With J. J. O’Molloy he came forth slowly into <span class="place" id="instance_5957">Mary’s abbey</span>
      where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal,
      O’Connor, <span class="place" id="instance_5958">Wexford</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      He stood to read the card in his hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      —The reverend Hugh C. Love, <span class="place" id="instance_5959">Rathcoffey</span>. Present address: Saint
      Michael’s, <span class="place" id="instance_5960">Sallins</span>. Nice young chap he is. He’s writing a book about the
      Fitzgeralds he told me. He’s well up in history, faith.
    </p>

    <p>
      The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging
      twig.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O’Molloy said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.
    </p>

    <p>
      —God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of <span class="place" id="instance_5961">Kildare</span>
      after he set fire to <span class="place" id="instance_5962">Cashel cathedral</span>. You know that one? <em>I’m bloody
        sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop
        was inside</em>. He mightn’t like it, though. What? God, I’ll tell him
      anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they
      were all of them, the Geraldines.
    </p>

    <p>
      The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He
      slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:
    </p>

    <p>
      —Woa, sonny!
    </p>

    <p>
      He turned to J. J. O’Molloy and asked:
    </p>

    <p>
      —Well, Jack. What is it? What’s the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.
    </p>

    <p>
      With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an
      instant, sneezed loudly.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Chow! he said. Blast you!
    </p>

    <p>
      —The dust from those sacks, J. J. O’Molloy said politely.
    </p>

    <p>
      —No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your
      soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught...
    </p>

    <p>
      He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...
    </p>

    <p>
      —I was... <span class="place" id="instance_5963">Glasnevin</span> this morning... poor little... what do you call
      him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!

      booky’s vest and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got
      the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.  
    </p>

    <p>
      —The act of a hero, he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <span class="place" id="instance_5973">the Dolphin</span> they 
      halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past
      them for <span class="place" id="instance_5974">Jervis street</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      —This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5975">Lynam’s</span>
      to see Sceptre’s starting price. What’s the time by your gold watch and
      chain?
    </p>

    <p>
      M’Coy peered into 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5976">Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office</span>
      , then at <span class="place" id="instance_5977">O’Neill’s clock</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      —After three, he said. Who’s riding her?
    </p>

    <p>
      —O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.
    </p>

    <p>
      While he waited in <span class="place" id="instance_5978">
      Temple bar</span> M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle
      pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy
      get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <span class="place" id="instance_5979">
      gates of the drive</span> opened wide to give egress to the viceregal
      cavalcade.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons
      in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an
      earthly. Through here.
    </p>

    <p>
      They went up the steps and under <span class="place" id="instance_5980">
      Merchants’ arch</span>. A darkbacked figure
      scanned books on the hawker’s cart.
    </p>

    <p>
      —There he is, Lenehan said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye</em>, Lenehan said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said. I was with him one day and he
      bought a book from an old one in <span class="place" id="instance_5981">Liffey street</span> for two bob. There were
      fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and
      comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lenehan laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said. Come over
      in the sun.
    </p>

    <p> 
      They crossed to the <span class="place" id="instance_5982">metal
        bridge</span> and went along <span class="place"
        id="instance_5983">Wellington quay</span> by the riverwall.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5984">Mangan’s</span>, 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5985">late Fehrenbach’s</span>,
      carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.
    </p>

    <p>
      —There was a long spread out at <span class="place" id="instance_5986">Glencree reformatory</span>, Lenehan said
      eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord
      mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan
      Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin
      Dollard...
    </p>

    <p>
      —I know, M’Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Did she? Lenehan said.
    </p>

    <p>
      A card <em>Unfurnished Apartments</em> reappeared on the windowsash of number 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5987">7 Eccles street</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.
    </p>

    <p>
      —But wait till I tell you, he said. <span class="place" id="instance_5988">Delahunt of Camden street</span> had the
      catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were
      there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to
      which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came
      solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...
    </p>

    <p>
      —I know, M’Coy said. The year the missus was there...
    </p>

    <p>
      Lenehan linked his arm warmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      —But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after
      all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the
      morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s
      night on the <span class="place" id="instance_5989">Featherbed Mountain</span>. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one
      side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing
      glees and duets: <em>Lo, the early beam of morning</em>. She was well primed
      with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband. Every jolt the
      bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell’s delights! She
      has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:
    </p>

    <p>
      —I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know
      what I mean?
    </p>

    <p>
      His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in
      delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      —The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She’s a gamey
      mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets
      in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and
      Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was
      lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last
      she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. <em>And what star is that, Poldy?</em>
      says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. <em>That one, is it?</em> says Chris
      Callinan, <em>sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick.</em> By God, he
      wasn’t far wide of the mark.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I’m weak, he gasped.
    </p>

    <p>
      M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan
      walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead
      rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy.
    </p>

    <p>
      —He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He’s not one
      of your common or garden... you know... There’s a touch of the artist
      about old Bloom.

    <p>
      Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of <em>The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk</em>,
      then of Aristotle’s <em>Masterpiece</em>. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants
      cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.
      Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting
      with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere.
      Mrs Purefoy.
    </p>

    <p>
      He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: <em>Tales of the Ghetto</em>
      by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.
    </p>

    <p>
      —That I had, he said, pushing it by.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Them are two good ones, he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.
      He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his
      unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.
    </p>

    <p>
      On <span class="place" id="instance_5990">O’Connell bridge</span> many persons observed the grave deportment and gay
      apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. <em>Fair Tyrants</em> by James Lovebirch.
      Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.
    </p>

    <p>
      He opened it. Thought so.
    </p>

    <p>
      A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: The man.
    </p>

    <p>
      No: she wouldn’t like that much. Got her it once.
    </p>

    <p>
      He read the other title: <em>Sweets of Sin</em>. More in her line. Let us see.
    </p>

    <p>
      He read where his finger opened.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on
        wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes. This. Here. Try.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands
        felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes. Take this. The end.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.
        The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her
        queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played
        round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Bloom read again: <em>The beautiful woman</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply
      amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched
      themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (<em>for him! For Raoul!</em>).
      Armpits’ oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (<em>her heaving embonpoint!</em>). Feel!
      Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!
    </p>

    <p>
      Young! Young!
    </p>

    <p>
      An elderly female, no more young, left the <span class="place" id="instance_5991">
      building of the courts of chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas</span>, having heard in
      the lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the
      admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the
      Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal
      reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident
      and Guarantee Corporation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the <span class="place" id="instance_5992">bookshop</span>, bulging out the dingy
      curtains. The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
      reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the
      floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it,
      and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Bloom beheld it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mastering his troubled breath, he said:
    </p>

    <p>
      —I’ll take this one.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Sweets of Sin</em>, he said, tapping on it. That’s a good one.

    <p>
      The lacquey by the door of <span class="place" id="instance_5993">Dillon’s auctionrooms</span> shook his handbell
      twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the <span class="place" id="instance_5994">curbstone</span>, heard the beats of the
      bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely
      curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any
      advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:
    </p>

    <p>
      —Barang!
    </p>

    <p>
      Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.
      J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched
      necks wagging, negotiated <span class="place" id="instance_5995">the curve</span> 
      by the <span class="place" id="instance_5996">College library</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5997">Williams’s row</span>. He
      halted near his daughter.
    </p>

    <p>
      —It’s time for you, she said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.
      Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon
      shoulder? Melancholy God!
    </p>

    <p>
      Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and
      held them back.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Stand up straight, girl, he said. You’ll get curvature of the spine. Do
      you know what you look like?
    </p>

    <p>
      He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders
      and dropping his underjaw.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Did you get any money? Dilly asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in 
      <span class="place" id="instance_5998">Dublin</span>
      would lend me fourpence.
    </p>

    <p>
      —You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      —How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along
      <span class="place" id="instance_5999">James’s street</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6000">Scotch house</span> now?
    </p>

    <p>
      —I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns
      taught you to be so saucy? Here.
    </p>

    <p>
      He handed her a shilling.
    </p>

    <p>
      —See if you can do anything with that, he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You’re like the rest of
      them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother
      died. But wait awhile. You’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from
      me. Low blackguardism! I’m going to get rid of you. Wouldn’t care if I
      was stretched out stiff. He’s dead. The man upstairs is dead.
    </p>

    <p>
      He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Well, what is it? he said, stopping.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Barang!
    </p>

    <p>
      —Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but
      feebly:
    </p>

    <p>
      —Bang!
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Dedalus stared at him.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Watch him, he said. It’s instructive. I wonder will he allow us to
      talk.
    </p>

    <p>
      —You got more than that, father, Dilly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll leave
      you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there’s all I have. I got
      two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the
      funeral.
    </p>

    <p>
      He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Can’t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6001">O’Connell street</span>. I’ll try this one now.
    </p>

    <p>
      —You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for
      yourself and a bun or a something. I’ll be home shortly.
    </p>

    <p>
      He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.
    </p>

    <p>
      The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of
      <span class="place" id="instance_6002">Parkgate</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lacquey banged loudly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing
      mincing mouth gently:
    </p>

    <p>
      —The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do anything!
      O, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica!

      From the <span class="place" id="instance_6003">sundial</span> 
      towards <span class="place" id="instance_6004">James’s gate</span> 
      walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the
      order he had booked for <span class="place" id="instance_6005">Pulbrook Robertson</span>, 
      boldly along <span class="place" id="instance_6006">James’s street</span>,
      past <span class="place" id="instance_6007">Shackleton’s offices</span>. 
      Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr
      Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6009">other establishment in Pimlico</span>. 
      How are things going? Just keeping alive.
      Lovely weather we’re having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those
      farmers are always grumbling. I’ll just take a thimbleful of your best
      gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that
      General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And
      heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal
      thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most
      scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the
      firehose all burst. What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever
      allowed a boat like that... Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.
      You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look
      at that. And <span class="place" id="instance_6010">America</span> 
      they say is the land of the free. I thought we were
      bad here.
    </p>

    <p>
      I smiled at him. <span class="place" id="instance_6011"><em>America</em></span>, 
      I said quietly, just like that. <em>What is it?
        The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn’t that true?</em>
      That’s a fact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s
      always someone to pick it up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy
      appearance. Bowls them over.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
    </p>

    <p>
      —Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6012">Peter Kennedy, hairdresser</span>. 
      Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6013">Dawson street</span>. 
      Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built
      under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6014">Kildare street club</span>

      bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on

      remembered me.

    <p>
      Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.
      Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom
      again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying
      has it.

      Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.
      Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy
      body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned
      Lambert’s brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He’s as like it as damn
      it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash
      like that. Damn like him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good
      drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his
      fat strut.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="place" id="instance_6018">Down there Emmet was hanged,

    <p>
      Let me see. Is he buried in 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6019">saint Michan’s</span>? 
      Or no, there was a midnight
      burial in <span class="place" id="instance_6020">Glasnevin</span>. 
      Corpse brought in through a secret door in the
      wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn
      down here. Make a detour.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6021">Watling street</span> by
      the corner of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6022">Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom</span>. 
      Outside the <span class="place" id="instance_6023">Dublin Distillers Company’s stores</span> 
      an outside car without fare or jarvey stood,
      the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6024">Tipperary</span>

      Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6025">John Henry Menton’s office</span>, 
      led his wife over 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6026">O’Connell bridge</span>, bound for the
      <span class="place" id="instance_6027">office of Messrs Collis and Ward</span>.

    <p>
      Mr Kernan approached <span class="place" id="instance_6028">Island street</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those
      reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all
      now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6029">Daly’s</span>. No

      Damn good gin that was.

    <p>
      Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that
      sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were
      on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that
      is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad
      touchingly. Masterly rendition.

      <em>At the siege of <span class="place" id="instance_6032">Ross</span> did my father fall.</em>

      A cavalcade in easy trot along 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6033">Pembroke quay</span> passed, 
      outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. 
      Cream sunshades.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.
    </p>

    <p>
      His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a
      pity!

      Stephen Dedalus watched through 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6034">the webbed window</span> 
      the lapidary’s fingers
      prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust
      darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept
      on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies,
      leprous and winedark stones.
    </p>

    <p>
      Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights
      shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of
      their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman,
      rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed
      silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her
      hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.
    </p>

    <p>
      Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it
      and held it at the point of his Moses’ beard. Grandfather ape gloating
      on a stolen hoard.
    </p>

    <p>
      And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words
      of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat
      standing from everlasting to everlasting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through
      <span class="place" id="instance_6035">Irishtown</span> 
      along <span class="place" id="instance_6036">London bridge road</span>, 
      one with a sanded tired umbrella,
      one with a midwife’s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.
    </p>

    <p>
      The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6037">the powerhouse</span> 
      urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always
      without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I
      between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.
      Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me
      you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A
      look around.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say
      right, sir. A Monday morning, ’twas so, indeed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stephen went down <span class="place" id="instance_6038">Bedford row</span>, 
      the handle of the ash clacking against
      his shoulderblade. In <span class="place" id="instance_6039">Clohissey’s</span> 
      window a faded 1860 print of Heenan
      boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood
      round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed
      gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes’
      hearts.
    </p>

    <p>
      He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.

    <p>
      —Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.

      Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet
      of <span class="place" id="instance_6042">Donnycarney</span>, murmuring vespers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses.
      Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read.
      Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for
      white wine vinegar. How to win a woman’s love. For me this. Say the
      following talisman three times with hands folded:
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter
      Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot’s
      charms, as mumbling Joachim’s. Down, baldynoddle, or we’ll wool your
      wool.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What are you doing here, Stephen?
    </p>

    <p>
      Dilly’s high shoulders and shabby dress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shut the book quick. Don’t let see.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What are you doing? Stephen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It
      glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her
      of <span class="place" id="instance_6043">Paris</span>. 
      Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a
      pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly’s token. <em>Nebrakada femininum</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What have you there? Stephen asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing
      nervously. Is it any good?
    </p>

    <p>
      My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring.
      Shadow of my mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal’s French primer.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?
    </p>

    <p>
      She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      Show no surprise. Quite natural.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Here, Stephen said. It’s all right. Mind Maggy doesn’t pawn it on you.
      I suppose all my books are gone.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Some, Dilly said. We had to.
    </p>

    <p>
      She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will
      drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,
      my heart, my soul. Salt green death.
    </p>

    <p>
      We.

    <p>
      —Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
    </p>

    <p>
      —Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
    </p>

    <p>
      They clasped hands loudly outside 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6044">Reddy and Daughter’s</span>. Father Cowley
      brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What’s the best news? Mr Dedalus said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I’m barricaded up, Simon, with
      two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?
    </p>

    <p>
      —O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.
    </p>

    <p>
      —With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      —The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I’m just
      waiting for Ben Dollard. He’s going to say a word to long John to get
      him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked with vague hope up and down 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6047">the quay</span>, 
      a big apple bulging in
      his neck.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always
      doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!
    </p>

    <p>
      He put on his glasses and gazed towards the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6046">metal bridge</span> an instant.
    </p>

    <p>
      —There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
      crossed <span class="place" id="instance_6047">the quay</span> in full gait from the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6048">metal bridge</span>. He came towards
      them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:
    </p>

    <p>
      —Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben
      Dollard’s figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered
      sneeringly:
    </p>

    <p>
      —That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?
    </p>

    <p>
      —Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I
      threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.
    </p>

    <p>
      He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes
      from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:
    </p>

    <p>
      —They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to
      God he’s not paid yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      —And how is that <em>basso profondo</em>, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,
      glassyeyed, strode past the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6049">Kildare street club</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a
      deep note.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Aw! he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?
    </p>

    <p>
      He turned to both.
    </p>

    <p>
      —That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6050">old chapterhouse of saint Mary’s abbey</span> 
      past <span class="place" id="instance_6051">James and Charles Kennedy’s</span>, 
      rectifiers, attended by
      Geraldines tall and personable, towards the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6052">Tholsel</span> beyond the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6053">ford of hurdles</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
      his joyful fingers in the air.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Come along with me to 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6054">the subsheriff’s office</span>, 
      he said. I want to
      show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He’s a cross between
      Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He’s well worth seeing, mind you. Come along.
      I saw John Henry Menton casually in the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6055">Bodega</span> just now and it will
      cost me a fall if I don’t... Wait awhile... We’re on the right lay, Bob,
      believe you me.
    </p>

    <p>
      —For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
      of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
      heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What few days? he boomed. Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?
    </p>

    <p>
      —He has, Father Cowley said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben
      Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the
      particulars. 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6056">29 Windsor avenue</span>. 
      Love is the name?
    </p>

    <p>
      —That’s right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He’s a minister
      in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?
    </p>

    <p>
      —You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that
      writ where Jacko put the nuts.
    </p>

    <p>
      He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his
      glasses on his coatfront, following them.

      —Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father

      John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them

    <p>
      On the steps of the <span class="place" id="instance_6061">City hall</span> 
      Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed
      Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.

      The castle car wheeled empty into

      I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the
      five shillings too.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Without a second word either, Mr Power said.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.
    </p>

    <p>
      John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.

    <p>
      —I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.

    <p>
      Outside <span class="place" id="instance_6066"><em>la Maison

  <span class="place" id="instance_6067">the liberties</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took
      the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
      uncertainly, with hasty steps past 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6068">Micky Anderson’s watches</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      —The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse
      Nolan told Mr Power.
    </p>

    <p>
      They followed round the corner towards 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6069">James Kavanagh’s winerooms</span>. 
      The empty castle car fronted them at rest in 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6070">Essex gate</span>. Martin Cunningham,
      speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not
      glance.
    </p>

    <p>
      —And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as
      life.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and
      greeted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay
      decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all
      their faces.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he
      said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,
      about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted
      to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the
      macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,
      no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6071">Llandudno</span> and little
      Lorcan Sherlock doing <em>locum tenens</em> for him. Damned Irish language,
      language of our forefathers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the
      assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his
      peace.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.
    </p>

    <p>
      —O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness’ sake till
      I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!
    </p>

    <p>
      Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and
      passed in and up the stairs.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don’t think you
      knew him or perhaps you did, though.
    </p>

    <p>
      With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long
      John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Rather lowsized. Dignam of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6072">Menton’s office</span> 
      that was, Martin Cunningham said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Long John Fanning could not remember him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What’s that? Martin Cunningham said.
    </p>

    <p>
      All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the
      cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6073">Parliament street</span>,
      harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past
      before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders,
      leaping leaders, rode outriders.
    </p>

    <p>
      —What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.
    </p>

    <p>
      —The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse
      Nolan answered from the stairfoot.

    <p>
      As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his
      <span class="place" id="instance_6074">Panama</span> to Haines:
    </p>

    <p>
      —Parnell’s brother. There in the corner.
    </p>

    <p>
      They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose
      beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Yes, Mulligan said. That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.
    </p>

    <p>
      John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
      went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under
      its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell
      once more upon a working corner.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I’ll take a <em>mélange</em>, Haines said to the waitress.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Two <em>mélanges</em>, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter
      and some cakes as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      When she had gone he said, laughing:
    </p>

    <p>
      —We call it <span class="place" id="instance_6075">D. B. C.</span> 
      because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed
      Dedalus on <em>Hamlet</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Haines opened his newbought book.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I’m sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds
      that have lost their balance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6076">14 Nelson street</span>:
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>England expects</em>...
    </p>

    <p>
      Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.
    </p>

    <p>
      —You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering
      Ængus I call him.
    </p>

    <p>
      —I am sure he has an <em>idée fixe</em>, Haines said, pinching his chin
      thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it
      would be likely to be. Such persons always have.
    </p>

    <p>
      Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.
    </p>

    <p>
      —They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never
      capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white
      death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.
      The joy of creation...
    </p>

    <p>
      —Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him
      this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw.
      It’s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6077">Vienna</span> makes an
      interesting point out of that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to
      unload her tray.
    </p>

    <p>
      —He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid
      the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,
      of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does
      he write anything for your movement?
    </p>

    <p>
      He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.
      Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its
      smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write
      something in ten years.
    </p>

    <p>
      —Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.
      Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.
    </p>

    <p>
      —This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don’t
      want to be imposed on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of
      ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6078">new Wapping street</span> past

      Almidano Artifoni walked past 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6081">Holles street</span>, past 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6082l">Sewell’s yard</span>.
      Behind him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with
      stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6083">Mr Law Smith’s house</span> and, 
      crossing, walked along 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6087">Merrion square</span>. Distantly behind him a
      blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6085">College park</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as
      <span class="place" id="instance_6086">Mr Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows</span>, 
      then turned and strode back along
      <span class="place" id="instance_6087">Merrion square</span>, 
      his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the corner of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6088">Wilde’s house</span> he halted, 
      frowned at Elijah’s name
      announced on the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6089">Metropolitan hall</span>, 
      frowned at the distant pleasance of
      <span class="place" id="instance_6090">duke’s lawn</span>. 
      His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth
      bared he muttered:
    </p>

    <p>
      —<em>Coactus volui</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      He strode on for <span class="place" id="instance_6091">Clare street</span>, 
      grinding his fierce word.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he strode past 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6092">Mr Bloom’s dental windows</span> 
      the sway of his dustcoat
      brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,
      having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly
      face after the striding form.
    </p>

    <p>
      —God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You’re blinder nor

      Opposite <span class="place" id="instance_6093">Ruggy O’Donohoe’s</span> 
      Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the
      pound and a half of <span class="place" id="instance_6094">Mangan’s</span>, 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6173">late Fehrenbach’s</span>, 
      porksteaks he had been
      sent for, went along warm 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6095">Wicklow street</span> 
      dawdling. It was too blooming
      dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs
      MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping
      sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6096">Tunney’s</span>.
      And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole
      blooming time and sighing.
    </p>

    <p>
      After <span class="place" id="instance_6097">Wicklow lane</span> 
      the <span class="place" id="instance_6098">window of Madame Doyle</span>, 
      courtdress milliner,
      stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their
      pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning
      Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6099">Dublin</span>’s pet lamb, will
      meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6100">Portobello</span> bruiser, 
      for a purse of fifty
      sovereigns. Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh,
      that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar
      entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master
      Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That’s me in mourning. When
      is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He
      turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry,
      his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the
      image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One
      of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old
      fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going
      for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would
      knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for
      science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of
      him, dodging and all.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <span class="place" id="instance_6101">Grafton street</span> 
      Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and
      a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
      telling him and grinning all the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      No <span class="place" id="instance_6102">Sandymount</span> tram.
    </p>

    <p>
      Master Dignam walked along 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6103">Nassau street</span>, 
      shifted the porksteaks to
      his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The
      blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming
      end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I’m not going tomorrow
      either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice
      I’m in mourning? Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight.
      Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s
      name.
    </p>

    <p>
      His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a
      fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they
      were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were
      bringing it downstairs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling
      the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and
      heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing
      on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6104">Tunney’s</span> for
      to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him
      again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be
      a good son to ma. I couldn’t hear the other things he said but I saw
      his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was
      Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he’s in purgatory now because he went to
      confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.

      Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head watched and admired. On

      <span class="place" id="instance_6142">Dudley</span> fixed on him, took his thumbs
      quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap
      to her. A charming <em>soubrette</em>, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and
      lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl
      of <span class="place" id="instance_6143">Dudley</span>, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon
      the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6144">D. B. C.</span> Buck
      Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage
      over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the
      chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6145">Fownes’s street</span> 
      Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal’s first
      French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the
      glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6146">Commercial Buildings</span>,
      stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not
      looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6147">King Billy’s horse</span> 
      pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband
      back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the
      tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast
      and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C.,
      agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6148">Ponsonby’s corner</span> a jaded
      white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind
      him, E.L.Y.‘S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite
      <span class="place" id="instance_6149">Pigott’s music warerooms</span> 
      Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c,
      gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.
      By <span class="place" id="instance_6150">the provost’s wall</span> 
      came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes
      and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of 
      <em>My girl’s a 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6151">Yorkshire</span> girl</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders’ skyblue frontlets and high
      action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a
      suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute
      but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and
      the red flower between his lips. As they drove along 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6152">Nassau street</span> His
      Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of
      music which was being discoursed in 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6153">College park</span>. 
      Unseen brazen highland
      laddies blared and drumthumped after the <em>cortège</em>:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>
        But though she’s a factory lass<br/>
        And wears no fancy clothes.<br/>
        Baraabum.<br/>
        Yet I’ve a sort of a<br/>
        <span class="place" id="instance_6154">Yorkshire</span> relish for<br/>
        My little <span class="place" id="instance_6155">Yorkshire</span> rose.<br/>
        Baraabum.<br/>
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.
      Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson,
      C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6156">Finn’s hotel</span> 
      Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a
      fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons
      in the window of the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6157">Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate</span>. 
      Deep in <span class="place" id="instance_6158">Leinster street</span> by 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6159">Trinity’s postern</span> 
      a loyal king’s man, Hornblower, touched
      his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6160">Merrion square</span> Master
      Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent
      with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased
      by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to
      inaugurate the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6161">Mirus bazaar</span> in aid of funds for 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6162">Mercer’s hospital</span>,
      drove with his following towards 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6163">Lower Mount street</span>. 
      He passed a blind stripling opposite 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6164">Broadbent’s</span>. 
      In <span class="place" id="instance_6165">Lower Mount street</span> 
      a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, 
      passed swiftly and unscathed across
      the viceroy’s path. At the 
      <span class="place" id="instance_6166">Royal Canal bridge</span>, 
      from his hoarding,
      Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to
      <span class="place" id="instance_6167">Pembroke township</span>. 
      At <span class="place" id="instance_6168">Haddington road corner</span> 
      two sanded women halted
      themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view
      with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain.
      On <span class="place" id="instance_6169">Northumberland and Lansdowne roads</span> 
      His Excellency acknowledged
      punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small
      schoolboys at the garden gate of <span class="place" id="instance_6170">the 
        house said to have been admired by the late queen</span> 
      when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the
      prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni’s sturdy
      trousers swallowed by a closing door.
